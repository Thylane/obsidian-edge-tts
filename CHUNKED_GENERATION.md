# Chunked MP3 Generation

## Overview

The Edge TTS plugin now supports **chunked MP3 generation** for long notes that exceed the standard processing limits. This feature automatically splits long content into manageable chunks, generates audio for each chunk, and combines them into a single MP3 file.

## Content Limits

The plugin enforces absolute maximum limits for MP3 generation to ensure reliable performance:

-   **Maximum Words**: 5,000 words
-   **Maximum Characters**: 30,000 characters

If your content exceeds these limits, the plugin will:

1. Automatically truncate the content at a smart boundary (sentence or word break)
2. Show a notice explaining what happened
3. Proceed with MP3 generation using the truncated content

These limits are not user-configurable and apply to all MP3 generation methods (regular, chunked, and force chunked).

## When is Chunked Generation Used?

Chunked generation is automatically triggered when:

-   A note contains more than **1,500 words** OR
-   A note contains more than **9,000 characters** (configurable via settings)

Note: Even with chunked generation, the absolute maximum limits above still apply.

## How It Works

1. **Content Validation**: Check if content exceeds absolute maximum limits and truncate if necessary
2. **Text Splitting**: The note content is intelligently split into chunks, preserving sentence and paragraph boundaries when possible
3. **Chunk Processing**: Each chunk is processed individually using the Edge TTS service
4. **Progress Tracking**: A visual progress indicator shows the status of each chunk
5. **Audio Combination**: All successfully generated chunks are combined into a single MP3 file

## Progress Indicator

When chunked generation is active, you'll see a progress indicator positioned above the status bar in the bottom-right corner of Obsidian. This indicator shows:

-   **Current Phase**: Splitting, Generating, Combining, or Completed
-   **Overall Progress**: Percentage of completion
-   **Chunk Status**: Individual progress for each chunk with visual indicators
-   **Note Title**: The name of the note being processed
-   **Truncation Notice**: If content was truncated due to limits

### Chunk Status Icons

-   üïí **Pending**: Waiting to be processed
-   ‚öôÔ∏è **Processing**: Currently generating audio (with progress percentage)
-   ‚úÖ **Completed**: Successfully generated
-   ‚ùå **Failed**: Error occurred during generation

## Configuration

### Chunk Size Setting

You can adjust the chunk size in the plugin settings under "Extra settings":

-   **Range**: 5,000 - 15,000 characters per chunk
-   **Default**: 9,000 characters
-   **Recommendation**: Smaller chunks are more reliable but take longer to process

### Commands

-   **Generate MP3**: Automatically uses chunked generation for long notes
-   **Force chunked MP3 generation**: Manually trigger chunked generation for any note (useful for testing)

## Error Handling

The chunked generation system is designed to be resilient:

-   If a chunk fails to generate, the process continues with remaining chunks
-   Failed chunks are visually indicated in the progress display
-   The final MP3 will contain all successfully generated chunks
-   Detailed error messages are shown for troubleshooting

## Performance Considerations

-   **Processing Time**: Chunked generation takes longer than standard generation due to sequential processing
-   **Memory Usage**: Lower memory usage compared to processing very long texts as single units
-   **Network**: Each chunk requires a separate API call to the Edge TTS service
-   **Rate Limiting**: A 500ms delay is added between chunks to avoid overwhelming the service
-   **Content Limits**: Very large documents may be truncated to stay within the 5,000 word / 30,000 character limits

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Optimize Content**: Remove unnecessary formatting and content before generation
2. **Adjust Chunk Size**: Use smaller chunks for very long documents or if experiencing failures
3. **Monitor Progress**: The progress indicator provides real-time feedback on generation status
4. **Error Recovery**: If some chunks fail, you can retry generation or manually split the content
5. **Content Length**: Be aware of the absolute maximum limits - consider splitting very long documents into separate notes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Content Truncated**: Your note exceeds 5,000 words or 30,000 characters - consider splitting into multiple notes
2. **Timeout Errors**: Try reducing the chunk size in settings
3. **Network Issues**: Check your internet connection and retry
4. **Memory Issues**: Close other applications and reduce chunk size
5. **Service Limits**: The Edge TTS service may have daily or hourly limits

### Getting Help

If you encounter persistent issues with chunked generation:

1. Check the browser console for detailed error messages
2. Try reducing the chunk size setting
3. Test with the "Force chunked MP3 generation" command on smaller text
4. Consider splitting very long content into multiple notes
5. Report issues on the plugin's GitHub repository

## Technical Details

-   **Content Limits**: 5,000 words or 30,000 characters maximum (enforced before processing)
-   **Text Processing**: Content is filtered and cleaned before chunking
-   **Chunk Boundaries**: Attempts to split at paragraph and sentence boundaries
-   **Audio Format**: Uses MP3 format for maximum compatibility
-   **Combination Method**: Simple concatenation of MP3 buffers
-   **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of partial failures
-   **Smart Truncation**: When content exceeds limits, truncation occurs at sentence or word boundaries
